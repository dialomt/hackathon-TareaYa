## Overview

This project is a web application built using React for the front end and PHP for the backend. It facilitates the sales of services by administrators and purchases by users. The React framework is used for the front end, with react-router-dom for client-side routing, and the backend is implemented in PHP.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization for administrators and users.

- **Administrator Dashboard:** Management interface for administrators to add, edit, or remove services.
- **User Purchase Flow:** Seamless flow for users to select and purchase services.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Trello:** We use Trello as our primary project and task management tool. It facilitates collaboration and monitoring the progress of the various stages of development.
- **Figma:** We design and prototype our user interfaces with Figma. Real-time collaboration and feedback capabilities make Figma essential in our design process.
