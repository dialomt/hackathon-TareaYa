## Overview

This project involved the creation of multiple-page website combining React with Vite, PHP, and MySQL. The client, TareaYa - an up and coming name in the home-based skills and services market - wanted a fresh new look for their website with a focus on a simple design and an intuitive user flow. The site allows users to browse, favorite, contact and contract services provided by those placing advertisements. Likewise, service providers can upload new advertisements with space to set their price, location, specialities, and more, as well as the possibility to reply to interested users and create the perfect match!

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization for service providers and users.
- **Service Listings:** Display of available services with details for users to browse.
- **Administrator Dashboard:** Management interface for service providers to add, edit, or remove services.
- **User Purchase Flow:** Seamless flow for users to select and purchase services.
